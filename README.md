# repid

The `repid` package is an async Redis queue for Python, built around `aioredis`.

It can be easily used near to existing `aioredis` instances. Integration with other packages (such as `fastapi`) is quite simple too!

## Installation

Run

```bash
poetry add repid
```

Or

```bash
pip install repid
```
