## Example

Here is how the easiest example of producer-consumer application can look like.

Producer:

```python
import asyncio

from repid import Connection, Job, RabbitMessageBroker, Repid

app = Repid(Connection(RabbitMessageBroker("amqp://user:password@localhost:5672")))


async def main() -> None:
    async with app.magic():
        await Job(name="awesome_job").enqueue()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Consumer:

```python
import asyncio

from repid import Connection, RabbitMessageBroker, Repid, Router, Worker

app = Repid(Connection(RabbitMessageBroker("amqp://user:password@localhost:5672")))
router = Router()


@router.actor
async def awesome_job() -> None:
    print("Hello async jobs!")
    await asyncio.sleep(1.0)


async def main() -> None:
    async with app.magic():
        await Worker(routers=[router]).run()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Install

**Repid** supports Python versions 3.8 and up and is installable via `pip`.

```bash
pip install repid
```

There are also a couple of additional dependencies you may want to install, depending on your use case, e.g.

```bash
pip install repid[amqp, redis, cron]
```

## Why repid?

### Asyncio

`Repid` is built around `asyncio`. It means it's pretty fast.
And you don't have to worry that it will slow down your other asyncio-driven code.

### Ease of integration

There is an abstraction layer on top of other queue solutions. It means that even if `repid` doesn't provide some broker out of the box, you will be able to write your own.

### Built with microservices in mind

Your producer and consumer can be running in different containers, `repid` will handle it just fine.

### Can be used with other languages

`Repid` uses json (de-)serialization by default, which makes integration with other languages as easy as possible. You're also able to easily override default (de-)serialization behavior thanks to PEP 544 Protocols.

### Integrated scheduling

`Repid` has its own scheduling mechanisms.
You can delay job execution until some date or even execute it every once in a while.
No need for extra dependencies!

## Inspiration

`Repid` is inspired by [`dramatiq`](https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq) and [`arq`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/arq).
